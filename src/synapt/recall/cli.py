    THAT workspace's real build.lock and rebuilds ITS index using THIS
    cwd's content: a cross-workspace index corruption, not merely a wrong
    read.

    v3 (Stromus's R2 on v2, m_4422aa09): a bare root-vs-root COMPARISON
    refuses a shape that is legitimate BY DESIGN -- every real agent desk on
    this host is a filesystem SIBLING of the team's shared GRIPSPACE_ROOT,
    so ``source_root != index_root`` is true for every correctly-spawned
    desk, not just for a poisoned one. The fix is a DISCRIMINATOR, not a
    comparison: refuse only when source_dir's OWN gripspace is not itself
    POPULATED (no registered repo), reusing recall#1124's
    ``_gripspace_has_registered_repo`` -- the same signal that already
    distinguishes a real ``gr spawn``/``gr repo add`` worktree from a
    hand-built scratch dir for the marker-persistence half of this same
    incident. A populated source proves this cwd was deliberately set up as
    a desk; an unpopulated one is indistinguishable from the scratch dir a
    stray env var poisoned in the original incident.

    KNOWN LIMITATION, filed privately rather than detailed here: a
    populated gripspace belonging to a DIFFERENT TEAM than the one
    GRIPSPACE_ROOT names is not caught by this check -- "populated" only
    proves SOME repo is registered, not that it is the SAME team's. Closing
    that gap needs a registry signal this function does not have.

    Refuses before anything can touch build.lock, printing both paths and
    the fix. Skipped when ``--index`` was passed explicitly -- an explicit
    override is a deliberate choice (``project_data_dir`` suppresses the
    same env override the same way when project_dir is passed explicitly),

    independently of this process's lifetime. ``queued_background`` is
    honest about this: the render is not fresher than it was before the
    call, only headed there.

    # external service and runs on every build regardless. It also sat inside a

    #
    #   CONCAT is the baseline, and it is unaffected. The clustering step above
    #   pre-generates a concat summary for EVERY cluster on every build, skipping
    #   only those that already hold an LLM one. So no cluster is left without a
    #   summary by this change.
    #
    #   LLM is the upgrade, and it has two triggers. `process_build_promotions`
    #   upgrades by ACCESS TIER and still runs. The removed pass upgraded by
    #   SIZE, independent of access -- which is why its query looked for
    #   clusters where `method = 'llm'` was absent.
    #
    # So the residual is exactly this: a cluster that is large but rarely
    # searched keeps its concat summary and waits for `maintain` to be UPGRADED
    # to LLM quality. It does not go unsummarized.

    # the no-op check silently never fires.
    # RECOMPUTED, not the pre-build value. The build MUTATES ONE OF ITS OWN
    # SIGNED INPUTS: it synthesizes auto-journal stubs, so the journal on disk
    # after a build differs from the journal it read. Storing the pre-build
    # signature means the next run computes a different digest from an unchanged
    # workspace and the no-op can NEVER fire -- measured: pre 26636950,
    # post f4d4491d, on a workspace nobody touched in between.
    #
    # What is stored is therefore "the input state as of the end of this build",
    # which is exactly what the next run's pre-build signature is compared against.
    #
    # BUT A RECOMPUTE ALSO PICKS UP ARRIVALS. Anything that landed between the
    # index write and this line gets stat'd into the stored signature while
    # never having been read, so the next run compares equal, prints "Up to
    # date", and the content is invisible until something else happens to
    # change the digest. Measured on v3: a transcript dropped after the index
    # save was certified as indexed and returned zero content (Atlas, r2).
    #
    # So the signature is stored ONLY when the read-only inputs are unchanged
    # since the build read them. When they are not, the manifest keeps its file
    # list and carries NO signature, which `signature_from_manifest` resolves to
    # None and `is_noop` resolves to work. Failing toward one unnecessary build
    # is the same asymmetry the no-op check already documents, applied to the
    # one window where the build cannot vouch for its own inputs.
    #
    # TWO WINDOWS, TWO COMPARISONS, AND THE PERSISTED VALUE IS OLDER THAN BOTH.
    #   1. start -> read boundary: read-only inputs must not have moved while
    #      transcripts, channels and the archive were being parsed. Journals are
    #      excluded from THIS one only, because the build writes them in this
    #      window and would otherwise flag its own synthesis as an arrival.
    #   2. read boundary -> now: the full input set, all four classes, must be
    #      unchanged. Recomputed over the CURRENT sets rather than the ones read,
    #      so a file that APPEARED mid-build also fails -- the safe direction.
    # What is stored is `signature_at_read`, sampled before either comparison,
    # so an arrival at any later point -- including after this very check --
    # cannot be inside it. The next run then computes a different digest and
    # does the work.
    #
    # The first comparison is witnessed by the channel-arrival test. It
    # originally guarded mid-parse TRANSCRIPT arrivals; keying the signature on
    # `build_sources` subsumed that case, leaving it responsible for channels
    # and the archive, which are parsed before the journal read boundary.
    # Its witness pins store resolution through the explicit env seam rather
    # than inferring it from cwd -- an earlier attempt inferred, was defeated by
    # its own inference, and was wrongly reported as blocked by test isolation.
    # Compaction handoffs get an explicit continuity-metadata projection, so
    # SessionStart need not rely on their incidental ordinary-turn shape or

    ``index_oversize_source`` acquires ``build.lock`` itself (the default
    lock name, distinct from this function's own ``catchup.lock``), and
    that lock is only free once the build subprocess has released it by
