"""Symbol index over source files — an OSS primitive (recall#940).

Maps files to the symbols they declare, so a reader can ask *where is this
defined* and *what is in this file* without grepping. tree-sitter parses;
SQLite stores; nothing here knows about memory.

That last point is the design constraint, not an accident of scope. The index
records what the code SAYS. Reconstructing *why* it says it — joining a line
span to the conversations that produced it — is a separate concern that
composes on top of this module and never inside it. So this file imports no
memory layer, and a test asserts that over the parsed import graph rather than
trusting the reviewer to notice.

Two behaviours are worth knowing before reading the code:

**Change detection is by content hash, never mtime.** Branch switches and
formatters bump mtime on files whose bytes are identical; an mtime-driven index
would re-parse the world every time you changed branches.

**An unchanged file is skipped entirely — not re-stamped.** It would be natural
to refresh ``indexed_at`` on every pass, but that turns "nothing changed" into a
write per file and quietly makes the incremental path cost the same as a full
one. ``IndexStats.rows_written`` reports SQLite's own ``total_changes`` delta so
that claim is measurable instead of asserted.
