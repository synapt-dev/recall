"""Admit and index an agent's own Claude Code memory directory as a
recall source (R3 "Memory Everywhere" first fruit: what an agent wrote
in one runtime becomes available to the same agent in another runtime).

Self-scoped only: no agent name, role, or org identity is resolved or
stored anywhere in this module. The admission names a DIRECTORY -- the
same store-resolution coordinate ``project_data_dir()`` already computes
for this process -- not an agent. Team/org authorization and visibility
policy are out of scope for this module and may be layered on by a
downstream consumer without changing this admission's contract.

This indexes the ORIGINAL files in place via ``source_index.py``'s
generic engine. It does not copy their content into knowledge nodes the
way ``server.recall_sync_memory`` does -- that is the bulk-load the R3
acceptance fruit exists to avoid.
