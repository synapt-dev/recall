"""The session-start wake: what a fresh session sees first, and the hook's
own run log.

Two facts shape everything here (measured 2026-08-10 and 2026-08-25):

* The harness previews roughly the first 2 KB of a SessionStart hook's
  stdout and saves the rest to a file it does not tell the model to read.
  So the FIRST 2 KB is the whole briefing for most sessions, and whatever
  comes first consumes it.
* A hook killed at its timeout emits NOTHING, and nothing anywhere says so.
  The fresh session starts with no continuity context and no signal that
  any was missing — the failure that looks exactly like "nothing to say".

So the wake is rendered inside a fixed byte budget with a head line first,
the full text is written to disk and pointed at, and every run is recorded
started-then-completed so the NEXT run can report a predecessor that never
finished.
