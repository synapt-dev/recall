"""Topic clustering for recall chunks using token-overlap similarity.

Groups related chunks into clusters using greedy union-based Jaccard
clustering. No LLM or embeddings required — works purely on token overlap,
which is highly discriminative for code/engineering text where distinctive
tokens like "flock", "TOCTOU", "compact" carry strong signal.

Phase 1 of the intermediate storage layer.
Threshold raised from 0.15 to 0.20 for 85% cluster stability.

# instead of being screened out on its own.

    signatures (which skew toward older, already-clustered content) but
    23.9% of one actual stale-chunk batch (recently-fired activity), so a

    process vocabulary (agent names, "gate", "ratify", "merge"), and

    avoided, not silently wrong).

    A batch-derived drop list naming this team's OWN process words (e.g.
    "dev", "review", "channel" -- measured on a real batch) is expected and
    is not the signature-rejection problem repeating: it is recomputed from

    Jaccard: a signature is capped at ``TOP_SIGNATURE_TOKENS`` while a
    chunk commonly carries far more tokens, so Jaccard's union-sized
    denominator dilutes real overlap toward zero regardless of how
    thematically similar the chunk actually is.

    Containment alone is the false-merge shape for a SMALL signature: a
    10-token signature needs only 3 shared tokens to read 0.30 contained,
    which is coincidence, not similarity. ``min_shared_tokens`` is an
    absolute floor independent of the ratio, so a signature this small
    cannot match without substantial real overlap.

    A raw COUNT floor still lets a match through built entirely from
    common, recurring vocabulary shared with the signature (a harness
    prompt's own words, a status update's "quiet"/"standing by") -- shared
    tokens that recur across MANY clusters' signatures carry no real
    topical signal, however many of them there are.
    ``min_distinctive_shared_tokens`` is a separate, INDEPENDENT floor on
    HOW MANY of the shared tokens individually clear a per-token rarity
    ceiling (see ``_signature_cross_cluster_df`` -- how many DIFFERENT
    clusters' signatures contain each token, the cheap proxy for
    distinctiveness already loaded at the call site -- a token counts only
    if its df sits at or below ``total_clusters // rare_token_df_divisor``),
    not an average blended across the whole shared set. Shipped first as
    an average; measured wrong on the real store one batch
    later -- at the real cluster count an average lets a handful of
    genuinely rare tokens drag several common ones over the line with
    them, so a match dominated by boilerplate still cleared it. A
    per-token count cannot be dragged that way: a common token simply
    never counts, however many rare ones sit beside it. Below
    ``min_clusters_for_distinctiveness`` total clusters this check is
    skipped outright -- with too few clusters to compare against, every
    token trivially looks "common" (it IS the only, or one of a handful
    of, known signatures), which is an artifact of the population size,
    not evidence about the token, so the prior count/ratio-only behavior
    applies unchanged.

    Both floors are required independently: a small-but-rare match and a
    large-but-common match must both fail if either check alone is
    applied.

    A signature is also ineligible outright when it holds fewer than
    ``min_shared_tokens`` LETTER-BEARING tokens (see ``_has_letter``),
    checked directly against the signature rather than inferred from
    ``_chunk_tokens`` already excluding non-letter tokens on the chunk
    side: a signature persisted BEFORE that filter existed can still be
    sitting on disk full of coincidental line-number tokens (measured:
    one real signature was 64/64 bare numbers) until its
    next backfill, and this check keeps it from acting as a magnet for
    numbered-code chunks in the meantime, rather than relying only on the
    fact that a freshly-tokenized chunk can no longer contribute matching
    digits to ``shared``.

    ``min_candidate_containment`` is a SECOND, independent containment
    floor -- ``|shared| / |chunk_tokens|``, the CANDIDATE'S side, not the
    signature's -- required in addition to ``min_containment``. The two
    are not interchangeable: ``min_containment`` alone lets a small
    signature match on a coincidental handful of shared tokens regardless
    of how large or unrelated the candidate is (measured: a 558-token
    candidate sharing 9 words with a 12-token signature clears
    ``min_containment`` at 0.75 while sharing only 1.6% of its own
    content). See ``MIN_CANDIDATE_CONTAINMENT``'s module-level comment for
    the empirical margin this value is centered in.

    first; report the backlog.

    The memory bound that actually prevents a repeat of recall#435's OOM:
    this NEVER reloads the already-clustered corpus. It clusters only the
    selected batch among itself and calls ``append_clusters`` (additive).

    When ``merge_into_existing`` is set, a stale chunk gets a first chance
    to join an EXISTING cluster before self-batch clustering ever runs:
    ``load_cluster_token_signatures`` is a cheap read (cluster count, not
    chunk count) of every cluster's PERSISTED bounded signature -- the top
    ``TOP_SIGNATURE_TOKENS`` tokens by within-cluster document frequency,
    not the raw ``search_text`` sample (measured: symmetric Jaccard against
    search_text-derived tokens dilutes to ~0.05-0.10 regardless of real
    thematic overlap, because a chunk's own token set runs far larger than
    a short search_text sample). Each batch chunk is matched by asymmetric
    CONTAINMENT of the signature in its own tokens, with an absolute
    shared-token floor (see ``_match_existing_cluster``). A match grows
    that cluster in place (``merge_chunks_into_cluster`` -- membership
    added, chunk_count and search_text updated, cluster_id UNCHANGED since
    the id may already be referenced elsewhere; the cluster's now-stale
    signature is deleted so it re-enters the backfill queue). Chunks with
    no match fall through to self-batch clustering exactly as before.
    Default False: this changes which chunks a batch clusters, so it stays
    opt-in until the real-store numbers say otherwise. A cluster with no
    persisted signature yet (predates this table, or one that had a signature
    deleted by a recent merge) is simply absent from the comparison --
    ``backfill_cluster_signatures`` is the bounded op that fills it in.

    Batch SELECTION prefers chunks ``recluster_attempts`` has never seen:
    a chunk that fails to cluster is marked attempted and routed around on
    future runs until every never-tried chunk is exhausted, which is what
    keeps the op making forward progress instead of reselecting the same
    stuck chunks every time.

    Above ``refuse_above`` stale chunks (total backlog, not batch
    composition), refuses outright and reports the backlog plus the command
    that would drain it in batches, rather than attempting one huge batch:
    that many stale chunks means something is wrong (``skip_clustering``
    left on for a long stretch, most likely), not that a bigger single
    batch is safe.

    ``dry_run=True`` runs every comparison and computes the SAME receipt
    (``merged_into_existing``, ``chunks_clustered``, ``still_stale`` derived
    from the in-memory decisions rather than a post-write re-query) but
    skips every write (``merge_chunks_into_cluster``, ``append_clusters``,
    ``mark_recluster_attempted``) -- three rounds of hand-
    reading real merges each needed writing to the live store first (or a
    full copy of it) because no dry mode existed; this is that mode. The
    receipt also carries ``merge_samples`` (bounded by ``MERGE_SAMPLE_SIZE``,
    chunk id / target cluster id / target topic) regardless of ``dry_run``,
    so a hand-read never has to reconstruct which chunk went where from a
    before/after diff of the database again.
