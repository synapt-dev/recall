"""synapt.recall MCP server — expose transcript search as tools for Claude Code.

Provides recall tools via the Model Context Protocol, including:
  - recall_search: Search past session transcripts by keyword/topic
  - recall_quick: Fast, low-cost knowledge-only search for speculative checks
  - recall_context: Drill down into a search result for full raw content
  - recall_files: Find file history when you need prior context or rationale
  - recall_sessions: List recent sessions with summaries
  - recall_timeline: View chronological timeline of work arcs
  - recall_build: Build or rebuild the transcript index
  - recall_build_status: Read a durable background-build receipt
  - recall_setup: Initialize synapt recall for the current project
  - recall_stats: Get index statistics
  - recall_journal: Read or write session journal entries
  - recall_save: Explicitly save durable knowledge nodes
  - recall_remind: Manage cross-session reminders
  - recall_enrich: Enrich chunks with LLM-generated summaries
  - recall_consolidate: Extract durable knowledge from journal entries
  - recall_contradict: Manage pending knowledge contradictions

Can run standalone (synapt-recall-server) or be composed into the
unified synapt server via register_tools(mcp).

    Call this BEFORE starting work to check for prior decisions, bugs, or

    When to use (without being asked):
    - User mentions past work → search for it
    - Debugging an error → search for similar past errors
    - Making a design decision → check if it was discussed before
    - Starting a new feature → check for prior attempts or related work

    RESULT QUALITY:
        Use min_score to filter by relevance instead of fixed chunk counts.
        Results scoring below min_score × (best match score) are dropped.
        - min_score=0.2 (default): keep results ≥20% as relevant as the best match

    Args:
        query: Natural language query or keywords to search for.
        max_chunks: Maximum number of result chunks to return.
        max_tokens: Approximate token budget for the response.
        max_sessions: If set, only search the N most recent sessions.
        after: Only include results from after this date (ISO 8601, e.g. "2026-02-28").
        before: Only include results from before this date (ISO 8601, e.g. "2026-03-01").
        half_life: Days for recency decay to reach ~50%. 0 disables decay.
                   Default 60: a session from 2 months ago scores ~50% of today's,
                   making work from past quarters still discoverable.

        min_score: Minimum relevance threshold (0.0-1.0). Results scoring below
                   min_score × (top result score) are dropped. Default 0.2 via
                   threshold_ratio. Higher = fewer, more relevant results.
                   Lower = more results, potentially noisy. 0 = no filter.
        threshold_ratio: Deprecated — use min_score instead. Same behavior.
        depth: "full" returns knowledge + journal + transcript results.
               "summary" returns only knowledge nodes + journal entries.
               "concise" returns knowledge + cluster summaries (no raw chunks).
        context: Number of surrounding chunks to include per match (like grep -C).
                 0 = just the matching chunk. 2 = matching chunk + 2 before/after.
        min_confidence: Minimum confidence for knowledge node results (0.0-1.0).
                       Filters out low-quality extractions. 0 = no filter.
        top_k: If set >0, return only the top K results regardless of other limits.
               Like grep -m K. 0 = use max_chunks (default behavior).
        include_archived: If True, include archived clusters in concise mode results.
                          In full mode, individual chunks are always searchable regardless.
        include_historical: If True, include superseded/contradicted knowledge nodes
                            in results. When multiple versions exist in the same lineage,

    tail with the journal entry that session wrote, if any, and labels the
    index-freshness verdict so a stale view is never mistaken for a complete one.
    With no explicit session ID, the MCP caller is the server process's current
    working directory. Its newest indexed transcript wins before the shared
    store-wide fallback is considered.

    Use at session start, alongside recall_journal: the journal is what the
    previous session chose to write, this is what actually happened last. They
    diverge whenever work continued after the journal was written.

    Same surface as the `synapt resume` CLI.

    Args:
        session_id: Session to resume (prefix accepted). Default: the newest
            session rooted at the MCP server's current working directory.
        turns: Number of tail turns to show (default 10).

    """Execute a resolved Fix B contest: promote/restore/retire the two ALREADY-MATERIALIZED
    nodes from a contested pair (internal design spec, section 10.4).

    Returns ``True`` if the mutation actually happened, ``False`` otherwise (recall#905,
    0.17.0 blocker, Opus 2026-07-22 -- Part 2, co-primary). The caller MUST check this before
    marking the pending row resolved: a resolution that cannot complete must fail loud, never
    report success. ``None`` was the original return type — always, whether the mutation
    happened or silently no-opped — which is exactly how the caller's old ordering (mark
    resolved, then attempt the mutation) produced a false "resolved" success message for a
    contest whose candidate node hadn't been synced to SQLite yet.

    Deliberately separate from ``_apply_supersession`` — that function always CREATES a fresh
    node from queued text; a contest row already has both nodes persisted (the candidate was
    materialized at contest time, section 10.5), so this function only PROMOTES, RESTORES, or
    RETIRES existing rows. Entangling the two risked pulling this new mutation shape into
    ``_apply_supersession``'s own hardened, already-subtle bound-carrying logic (its docstring
    documents a real non-atomic-upsert landmine) that this shape doesn't need at all.

    *resolution* is one of "candidate_wins" / "existing_wins" / "false_positive" — the 3-way
    vocabulary contest resolution needs that the underlying confirmed/dismissed
    ``pending_contradictions.status`` column does not carry (section 10.4's deliberate
    layering: the caller maps this onto confirmed/dismissed for the shared column, and calls
    this function separately for the node-level mutation).

    Confidence is RECOMPUTED via ``compute_confidence`` on every node returning to active
    status, not preserved from its pre-contest value — simpler, avoids two more schema
    columns, matches how confidence is computed everywhere else a node returns to active
    (section 10.4's deliberate simplification, not an oversight).

    No-ops (mutates neither store, returns ``False``) if either node is missing -- but this
    is no longer SILENT the way it originally was (recall#905): the caller surfaces the
    ``False`` return as a loud, honest error and leaves the pending row unresolved, rather
    than treating a missing node the way ``_apply_supersession`` treats a deleted one (quiet
    tolerance is correct there because that path never claims a mutation succeeded when it
    didn't; this path's caller used to make exactly that false claim).

    DUAL-STORE (Sentinel r2, PR#903 issuecomment-5037168639 -- blocking): persists to BOTH
    SQLite (``db.upsert_knowledge_node``, immediate query-path correctness) AND
    ``knowledge.jsonl`` (``update_node``, the consolidation source-of-truth). The first
    version of this function wrote SQLite only, matching ``_apply_supersession``'s own
    SQLite-only shape -- but ``_apply_supersession`` isn't consolidation's own write path
    the way contest resolution effectively is: ``_sync_knowledge_to_db`` treats
    ``knowledge.jsonl`` as authoritative and does an unconditional ``INSERT OR REPLACE``
    from it into SQLite for every node present. Writing SQLite alone meant the very next
    sync silently reverted every valid resolution back to both-contested — deterministic,
    not crash-dependent (Opus's r1 under-rated this as a rare crash-mid-sequence risk;
    Sentinel's r2 found it fires on any ordinary sync). The update dicts below are computed
    once per branch and applied identically to both stores so the two writes can't drift
    apart from each other.

        A tool function never sees a mismatched argument name: FastMCP
        builds a per-tool Pydantic model from the function's signature and
        validates the raw call arguments against that model before the
        function is ever invoked. That model's default is to silently drop
        an unrecognized field, so a caller who misnames a field --
        ``accomplishments`` instead of ``recall_journal``'s real ``done``
        -- gets it discarded before dispatch; the tool then reports success
        with the content simply missing.

        This checks the raw arguments against each tool's own published
        schema (``list_tools()`` / ``Tool.inputSchema``, both part of the
        MCP wire protocol) before delegating to the real dispatch, so it
