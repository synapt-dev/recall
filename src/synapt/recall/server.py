"""synapt.recall MCP server — expose transcript search as tools for Claude Code.

Provides fifteen tools via the Model Context Protocol:
  - recall_search: Search past session transcripts by keyword/topic
  - recall_quick: Fast, low-cost knowledge-only search for speculative checks
  - recall_context: Drill down into a search result for full raw content
  - recall_files: Find file history when you need prior context or rationale
  - recall_sessions: List recent sessions with summaries
  - recall_timeline: View chronological timeline of work arcs
  - recall_build: Build or rebuild the transcript index
  - recall_setup: Initialize synapt recall for the current project
  - recall_stats: Get index statistics
  - recall_journal: Read or write session journal entries
  - recall_save: Explicitly save durable knowledge nodes
  - recall_remind: Manage cross-session reminders
  - recall_enrich: Enrich chunks with LLM-generated summaries
  - recall_consolidate: Extract durable knowledge from journal entries
  - recall_contradict: Manage pending knowledge contradictions
  - recall_career: Manage career lessons (premium stub)

Can run standalone (synapt-server) or be composed into the
unified synapt server via register_tools(mcp).

    """Search past coding sessions for relevant context. USE PROACTIVELY.

    Call this BEFORE starting work to check for prior decisions, bugs, or
    approaches. Returns relevant conversation chunks sorted by relevance.

    Works like grep: returns matching chunks with optional surrounding context.

    When to use (without being asked):
    - User mentions past work → search for it
    - Debugging an error → search for similar past errors
    - Making a design decision → check if it was discussed before
    - Starting a new feature → check for prior attempts or related work

    RESULT QUALITY:
        Use min_score to filter by relevance instead of fixed chunk counts.
        Results scoring below min_score × (best match score) are dropped.
        - min_score=0.2 (default): keep results ≥20% as relevant as the best match
        - min_score=0.5: stricter — only strong matches
        - min_score=0.0: return everything up to max_chunks (no quality filter)
        Combine with max_tokens to control context budget: "give me everything
        relevant, up to 2000 tokens."

    Args:
        query: Natural language query or keywords to search for.
        max_chunks: Maximum number of result chunks to return.
        max_tokens: Approximate token budget for the response.
        max_sessions: If set, only search the N most recent sessions.
        after: Only include results from after this date (ISO 8601, e.g. "2026-02-28").
        before: Only include results from before this date (ISO 8601, e.g. "2026-03-01").
        half_life: Days for recency decay to reach ~50%. 0 disables decay.
                   Default 60: a session from 2 months ago scores ~50% of today's,
                   making work from past quarters still discoverable.
                   Passed as None to lookup() so intent classification can
                   override when the caller uses the MCP default.
        min_score: Minimum relevance threshold (0.0-1.0). Results scoring below
                   min_score × (top result score) are dropped. Default 0.2 via
                   threshold_ratio. Higher = fewer, more relevant results.
                   Lower = more results, potentially noisy. 0 = no filter.
        threshold_ratio: Deprecated — use min_score instead. Same behavior.
        depth: "full" returns knowledge + journal + transcript results.
               "summary" returns only knowledge nodes + journal entries.
               "concise" returns knowledge + cluster summaries (no raw chunks).
        context: Number of surrounding chunks to include per match (like grep -C).
                 0 = just the matching chunk. 2 = matching chunk + 2 before/after.
        min_confidence: Minimum confidence for knowledge node results (0.0-1.0).
                       Filters out low-quality extractions. 0 = no filter.
        top_k: If set >0, return only the top K results regardless of other limits.
               Like grep -m K. 0 = use max_chunks (default behavior).
        include_archived: If True, include archived clusters in concise mode results.
                          In full mode, individual chunks are always searchable regardless.
        include_historical: If True, include superseded/contradicted knowledge nodes
                            in results. When multiple versions exist in the same lineage,
                            the highest-confidence one is kept (confidence-based fallback).

    Channels are append-only JSONL files in the shared .synapt/recall/ directory.
    Any agent (worktree) can post and read messages. No daemon needed.
    State (presence, cursors, pins) is stored in SQLite.

    Args:
        action: "join", "leave", "post", "read", "read_message", "who", "heartbeat", "unread",
                "pin", "directive", "mute", "unmute", "kick", "broadcast",
                "list", "search", "rename", "claim", "unclaim", "intent", "board".
        channel: Channel name (default "dev"). Any name works -- created on first post.
        message: Message body (required for "post", "directive", "broadcast") or message_id for "read_message"/pin actions.
        to: Target agent for "directive" action.
        target: Agent to mute/unmute/kick (agent_id, display name, or griptree name).
        limit: Max messages to return for "read" action (default 20).
        pin: If True with "post" action, also pin the message.
        name: Display name for this agent (set on join, shown in messages instead of agent ID).
        attachments: Semicolon-separated file paths to attach (copied into channel store on post).
        msg_type: Message type for "post" (status, claim, pr, code, message) or filter for "read".
            Default "message". On read, only messages matching the type are returned.
        show_pins: If False with "read" action, omit pinned messages from output (default True).
            Deprecated — use detail instead.
        detail: Output verbosity level. Controls pins, metadata, and truncation.
            "max"    — all pins, full messages, all metadata (IDs, claims, attachments)
            "high"   — all pins, full messages, message IDs only
            "medium" — full messages, IDs, claims, attachments; pins follow show_pins (default for "read")
            "low"    — no pins, truncated messages (200 chars), with refs for truncated messages
            "min"    — no pins, one-line per message, skip join/leave noise
            Use "low" or "min" for monitoring loops to save context budget.

    Coordination actions:
        claim: Claim a message/task by message_id (prevents duplicate work).
        unclaim: Release a previously claimed message_id.
        intent: Declare intent to create something (message = description of planned work).
