"""Session-tail reconstruction — the surface behind ``synapt resume``.

recall#927. When a session ends cleanly it writes a journal entry. When it ends
*uncleanly* — a crash, exhausted quota, a dead terminal — nothing is written, and
the next session has no way to ask *"what were the last things that happened, and
what did they intend?"* Relevance-ranked search cannot answer it: a cold query
like "where did we leave off" has no notion of recency, so it surfaces
mid-session chunks. This module answers it by position instead of by relevance.

Every design choice here is shaped by one property of the problem: a wrong answer
is *invisible*. A resume view that quietly drops the last turn, or pairs this
session's tail with a different session's intent, looks exactly like a correct
one. So the rules below are deliberately asymmetric — they prefer showing
something slightly noisy over hiding something real, and they label an inferred
pairing rather than presenting it as a proven one.

Runtime independence is structural at the rendered-tail boundary: anything the
parsers produce resumes identically. Caller freshness additionally reads the
last top-level timestamp from the caller-scoped live JSONL source. It does not
interpret runtime-specific event payloads.

    session entirely, and nothing says that hours of work have no record.

    A handoff is SESSION-BOUND evidence (Atlas, r1 on the first version of
    this): a journal certifies only the session it names. Reduced to a
