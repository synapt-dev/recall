"""recall_code: composes the code symbol index (code_index.py) with ordinary
recall_search to answer natural-language questions about this repo's code and
what the team has said about it. No new index, no new store -- read-only
composition over two existing OSS primitives, plus an optional per-hit
annotation discovered through the same entry-point seam shape already used
by ``synapt.backends`` (see ``_model_router.py``).

Design history (2026-09-02, exploratory-then-hardened): the naive tokenizer
first tried fed literal English filler words to find_symbols, which ranks
exact > prefix > SUBSTRING (code_index.py). "catch" from a natural-language
question substring-matched unrelated cmd_catchup-family symbols and crowded
out the actually-named symbol within a fixed result budget. A stopword
filter and a global rank-then-truncate sort (collect every candidate across
every token first, THEN sort by match kind, THEN truncate) close that gap
structurally: a token whose own substring noise alone reaches max_symbols
can no longer crowd out a later token's exact hit by arrival order, which a
stopword blocklist alone cannot guarantee (it is necessarily incomplete).

No intent classifier: recall_code stays best-effort and surfaces HOW each
hit matched (exact/prefix/substring) and which query token produced it, so
the caller judges relevance itself -- a question with no real symbol in it
(e.g. "why is config push-and-resolve to main with no PR") still returns
code hits, but every one reads as substring/prefix noise on a generic word
rather than a confident false positive."""
