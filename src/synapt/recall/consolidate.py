"""Memory consolidation — cross-session knowledge extraction.

Reads enriched journal entries, clusters related sessions, and uses
an LLM to distill durable knowledge patterns. Produces KnowledgeNodes
stored in knowledge.jsonl and indexed in SQLite.

Analogous to sleep consolidation in human memory: episodic memories
(journal entries) are replayed and compressed into semantic memory
(knowledge nodes).

Requires mlx-lm (pip install mlx-lm). Degrades gracefully if not installed.

You are analyzing session summaries to extract durable, specific knowledge.

## Project Context
{project_context}

## Existing Knowledge
{existing_knowledge}

## Recent Sessions
{journal_cluster}

## Examples of GOOD knowledge nodes (specific, concrete):
{good_examples}
(These show the FORMAT only. Do NOT copy these examples. Extract facts from the sessions above, using the real names and details found there.)

## Examples of BAD knowledge nodes (generic — NEVER produce these):
- "Always use Docker for containerization"
- "Use a consistent naming convention"
- "Write tests before deploying"
- "Use GPU for training"
- "Document your code thoroughly"

## Task
Extract patterns that represent durable knowledge — things true across sessions, not one-off observations.

Categories (use the best fit):
- fact: specific names, dates, relationships, numbers, personal details
- preference: stated likes, dislikes, choices about food, hobbies, etc.
- decision: explicit choices made between alternatives
- convention: agreed-upon patterns or rules
- workflow: recurring processes or routines
- architecture: system structure or design choices
- infrastructure: hosting, hardware, config values
- tooling: specific tools, versions, or setup
- debugging: diagnosed root causes or fixes
- lesson-learned: insights from mistakes or surprises

Rules:
1. Extract patterns that appear across sessions OR strongly-stated specific facts (names, preferences, relationships, config values).
2. If a newer session REVERSES a decision from an older session, mark it as a contradiction. Produce the NEW fact with "action": "contradict" and reference the old node's ID.
3. If a pattern matches an existing knowledge node, use "action": "corroborate" with the existing node's ID.
4. Keep each fact concise (1-2 sentences, max 200 chars).
5. Be concrete and specific — include specific names, values, paths, or details from the sessions.
6. Do NOT extract generic advice that could apply to any project. Every node must be grounded in the sessions above.
7. Prefer extracting granular personal details that would be hard to find later: nicknames, specific possessions, hobbies, places visited, family members, physical descriptions, stated opinions, specific dates/events.
8. Confidence guide: 0.7-0.9 = verified across 2+ sessions or very explicitly stated; 0.4-0.6 = from a single session with reasonable certainty; below 0.4 = inferred or speculative.
9. If no specific patterns emerge, output {{"nodes": []}}. Empty is better than generic.

Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences, no explanation:
{{"nodes": [{{"action": "create", "existing_id": null, "content": "...", "category": "...", "confidence": 0.6, "tags": ["tag1"], "contradiction_note": "", "source_turns": ["s001c00:5", "s003c00:12"], "valid_from": null, "valid_until": null}}]}}

source_turns: list the session:turn pairs where this fact appears. Format: "session_id:turn_number". Include ALL turns that support the fact — these are used to link back to the original conversation.

valid_from/valid_until: ISO 8601 dates (e.g. "2026-03-15") or null. Set these when the fact has clear temporal boundaries:
- "We migrated to PostgreSQL in March 2026" → valid_from: "2026-03-01"
- "The API key expires April 30" → valid_until: "2026-04-30"
- "Before the refactor, we used callbacks" → valid_until: (date of refactor session)
- Timeless facts (names, preferences) → both null
Only set dates you're confident about. null is better than guessing.

mentioned across multiple sessions.

## Existing Knowledge Nodes

## Task
Find entity collections: groups of 3+ similar items scattered across different sessions. \
For each collection, produce a single summary node that enumerates all instances.

Examples of collections:
- "User has 5 model kits: Revell F-15 (s3), Tamiya Spitfire (s7), B-29 bomber (s12), '69 Camaro (s14), Gundam RX-78 (s19)"
- "User visited 4 countries in 2025: Japan (s5), Italy (s8, s9), Brazil (s15), Iceland (s22)"
- "Project uses 3 databases: PostgreSQL for users (s2), Redis for cache (s4), Elasticsearch for search (s11)"

Rules:
1. Only create collections from entities ALREADY in existing knowledge nodes — do not invent items.
2. Each collection must reference 3+ items from 2+ different sessions.
3. Include the specific names/details and source sessions for each item.
4. Category is always "collection".
5. If an existing collection node covers the same entities, use "action": "corroborate" with its ID. \

# (existing_id:, contradiction_note:) bleeding into the content field. This set
# catches well-formed prose whose SUBJECT is journal bookkeeping or a one-off
# command execution -- content that parses cleanly and means nothing later.
#
# _lacks_specificity does not catch these: it reads a bare date as a specificity
# SIGNAL, so a bare "Session <hex-id>, <date>" tuple passes straight through it.
#
# ---- THE AXIS THIS FILTER DISCRIMINATES ON --------------------------------
#
# NOT "does this string contain a session hash, an ISO date, or a temp path".
# Those are TOKENS, and every one of them occurs in genuinely durable facts:
#
#   "Session deadbeef is the stable OAuth replay fixture used to verify rotation"
#   "Execute /migrate on 2027-01-15 only after the backup has completed"
#   "CI must never run rm -rf /tmp/shared-cache -- concurrent jobs share it"
#
# The first version of this filter matched exactly those tokens and ate all
# three. That is the same defect _lacks_specificity has, one layer over: it
# measures specificity TOKENS rather than specificity. Widening a pattern set
# cannot fix a discriminator that is pointed at the wrong quantity, and the
# false positives a reviewer happens to find are a SAMPLE of that surface, not
# its population.
#
# The property actually being filtered is:
#
#       does this content RECORD AN OCCURRENCE, or STATE A RULE?
#
# A record of one session, one command, one deletion is worthless months later.
# A rule ABOUT sessions, commands or deletions is exactly what memory is for.
#
# So each check below is TWO-PART:
#
#   1. a SHAPE gate   -- "this content is about a session id / a slash-command
#                         invocation / an ephemeral filesystem path"
#   2. a GRAMMAR test -- "...and it reports an occurrence rather than stating
#                         something that still holds"
#
# Shape alone is never a verdict. The burden of proof sits on the REJECT side,
# because a false reject destroys real memory silently while reporting a

# tests/recall/test_consolidate_noise.py; speculative additions can only widen
# the over-rejection surface, so they are not made.

# Positive evidence that content states something still in force: deontic

# THE MAINTENANCE RULE, and it is the whole reason this is split in two:

#     junk node survives. Add a grammatical CLASS (a quantifier, a conditional,
#     a modality), never a string lifted from one example -- fitting to
#     individual sentences rebuilds the token filter this design replaces.
#   * ADDING a reject shape below requires a pinned reject case FIRST. Its
#     worst case is silent deletion of real memory, which nothing downstream
#     can detect.
#
# The lists are therefore deliberately lopsided: three narrow reject shapes
# against an open-ended keep vocabulary. That is the design, not an imbalance

# ---- THE UNIT OF JUDGMENT IS THE CLAUSE, NOT THE STRING --------------------
#
# Three review rounds failed here, and they failed the same way: each changed
# WHICH SIGNALS were consulted, and none changed THE SCOPE A SIGNAL SPEAKS OVER.
# The defect underneath all three is one error with two faces:
#
#       A SIGNAL FOUND ANYWHERE IN THE CONTENT WAS TREATED
#       AS A VERDICT ABOUT ALL OF IT.
#
#   reject side -- a bookkeeping shape in ONE clause deleted EVERY clause,
#     including clauses asserting durable facts:
#       "The /migrate command ran on 2026-08-01 and permanently upgraded the
#        tenant schema to version 12, which fixes the lock-order defect."
#     The dated command echo is real. So is the schema state and the fix. The
#     whole fact was deleted on the strength of its first clause.
#
#   keep side -- a rule word in a REPORTED clause rescued EVERY clause,
#     including pure bookkeeping:
#       "Session a1b2c3d4 focused on what should happen next."
#     "should" is MENTIONED inside what the session was about. It is not
#     asserted by anyone, and it rescued a journal row.
#
# So occurrence-versus-rule was never the wrong axis; it was evaluated at the
# wrong GRANULARITY. An occurrence can carry a durable residue, and when it does
# the residue is the memory.
#
# The classes, in the form ratified by review:
#
#   CLASS A  standing assertion -- a proposition useful or true AFTER the
#            occurrence ends, REGARDLESS OF GRAMMATICAL SUBJECT. "Session
#            deadbeef ... exposed a lock-order bug" is class A: the subject is
#            the session and the bug outlives it. Durable facts routinely
#            arrive wearing occurrence clothing.
#   CLASS B  occurrence metadata ONLY -- time, duration, topic, command
#            execution, with no durable result.
#   CLASS C  reported content -- the complement of an attitude or reporting
#            predicate. Defined SEMANTICALLY, not by a closed verb list: it is
#            what someone focused on, was about, discussed. Vocabulary there is
#            MENTIONED, never asserted, so it licenses nothing about the matrix
#            claim. The recognizer below is necessarily partial; anything it
#            cannot identify is unknown, and unknown keeps.
#
# THE DECISION RULE, and note it is asymmetric on purpose:
#
#   REJECT  only if at least one clause is POSITIVELY identified class B
#           AND every remaining clause is B or C.
#   KEEP    on any class A clause, any unknown clause, or C-only content.
#           Class C alone can never condemn.
#
# That is the reject-side burden of proof made mechanical: deleting requires
# establishing that the content carries NO durable residue anywhere, and a
# shape match on one clause is evidence about THAT CLAUSE ONLY.


# Proposition boundaries: coordination, relative clauses, participials, and
# punctuation. Segmentation without a parser is approximate, and the errors are
# deliberately biased -- OVER-splitting yields more clauses and therefore more
# chances to find a class A, which lands on the keep side. UNDER-splitting fuses
# an occurrence with its residue and would delete the residue, so it is the
# failure worth avoiding.

# THREE THINGS ABOUT THIS SET ARE DELIBERATE AND WERE EACH EARNED BY A FINDING.
#
# 1. THE COLON IS NOT HERE AT ALL. A conditional colon split was tried, and a
#    reviewer proved the condition wrong in BOTH directions with one probe each:
#      false reject -- "...concluded the migration: production rejects SHA-1"
#                      (lowercase prose after a colon is ordinary; the capital
#                      guard refused to split, the residue stayed fused, and the
#                      real pipeline deleted the whole string)
#      false KEEP   -- "...focused on the incident archive: Production records"
#                      ("records" satisfies a finite-verb approximation while
#                      being a plural NOUN, so a reported topic split into an
#                      asserted-looking fragment and rescued pure bookkeeping)
#    "Capitalised token plus a word ending in s/ed" is not a subject-plus-finite
#    -verb discriminator, and no lexical test at this layer is. A guard wrong in
#    both directions is not a threshold miss, so it is DELETED rather than
#    retuned. Colons now inform the residue check below instead of splitting.
#
# 2. NO CAPITAL GUARD ON SENTENCE PUNCTUATION, and closing quotes are absorbed.
#    The earlier `(?=[A-Z])` was ASCII-only, so a Greek or Cyrillic sentence
#    start fused back into the occurrence, and a closing quote before the
#    capital did the same. Over-splitting produces more unclassifiable clauses,
#    and unknown keeps -- the safe direction. Version numbers and decimals carry
#    no space after the period, so they still never match.
#
# 3. CASE-INSENSITIVITY IS LOCAL, NOT PATTERN-WIDE. An earlier revision dropped
#    a pattern-level `(?i)` to make `[A-Z]` guards work and silently made the
#    PRE-EXISTING word branches case-sensitive too, so an uppercase "AND" or a
#    capitalised "Which" stopped splitting and deleted durable residue behind
#    them. Inline `(?i:...)` restores those branches without weakening anything
#    that needs case.


# A proposition needs a predicate. Coordination joins NOUNS at least as often as
# it joins clauses ("the first and last recorded events"), and splitting there
# produces a verbless fragment that is not a proposition at all -- it would be
# unclassifiable, and unknown keeps, so a journal row would survive on a
# grammatical accident. Fragments with no verb are re-joined to their neighbour.

    HONEST LIMITATIONS, in the order they will bite:

    1. Grammar is approximated LEXICALLY, with no parser. Three shapes of false
       keep follow from that, and all three are the chosen direction:

       (a) Quantification INSIDE one occasion reads like quantification over
           occasions. "Every entry logged during session 5517903 pertained to
           the same scratch directory" quantifies over one session's log lines.
       (b) Embedded rule vocabulary in an EPISODIC clause. "Session 9ab4f012
           concluded at 17:42; any remaining follow-up items should be picked
           up" asserts the modal in its own right, so it is class A by the
           contract even though the content is a journal row. Note this is
           NOT the reported-position case: "focused on what should happen next"
           mentions the modal inside a complement and is correctly rejected.
       (d) BOOKKEEPING CARRYING BOUNDARY RESIDUE IN ASSERTED POSITION.
           Content survives when a clause the shape gates would call class B
           still contains boundary-shaped material -- a colon or sentence
           punctuation followed by more text -- in the part of the clause that
           is ASSERTED. The detector cannot tell a missed proposition boundary
           from an internal one, so it demotes to unknown, and unknown keeps.

           TWO THINGS ARE OUTSIDE IT, both structural rather than enumerated:
           residue inside a REPORTED complement never reaches the detector,
           because ``_asserted_part`` strips it first; and an anchored
           whole-string journal tuple bypasses demotion entirely, because
           matching at both ends is a proof that nothing is hiding.

           STATED AS A MECHANISM ON PURPOSE, after three failures to state it
           as a case list. It read "multi-sentence bookkeeping with an internal
           colon", then "not an anchored tuple", then "not a whole-string
           tuple" -- each one accurate when written and false after the next
           round changed which cases qualified. A limitation section describes
           what the code CANNOT do, so it goes stale toward UNDERSTATING the
           code: harmless for a user, misleading for a reviewer who reads it as
           the current failure set. A mechanism goes stale only if the
           mechanism changes.

       (c) A PARTICIPIAL ADJUNCT that is shaped like a residue but carries
           none. "...was removed at the close of the run, leaving no residual
           files behind" separates into a clause this layer cannot classify,
           and unknown keeps.

       (c) is unavoidable given (and worth) the amendment that makes result-
       bearing occurrences survive: "/tmp/build-cache was removed after upload
       failed, exposing the cleanup race that truncated release manifests" has
       the IDENTICAL participial shape and must keep. Letting a participial
       inherit its host clause's class would reject both. No lexical test
       separates them without re-introducing the token discriminator this
       design exists to remove, so the cost is paid deliberately.

       MEASURED on an adversarial corpus built to exploit exactly this: of 14
       bookkeeping items inside the three shapes, 6 are rejected and 8 survive
       -- 6 by (a)/(b) and 2 by (c). The earlier whole-string version rejected
       8, and it bought those two extra rejections by deleting every
       result-bearing occurrence, which is the defect this revision closes.
       Demoting the keep evidence was also tried and measured: it bought 4 more
       rejections at the price of 5 durable facts, including "time to first
       byte is measured from the edge log line where session 9c4e1f occurred,
       never from the client clock". Both trades run the wrong way.
    2. A model that rewords a transient event into rule-shaped declarative prose
       slips past any fixed pattern set. So a low rejection count is NOT evidence
       of clean output -- verify quality by READING nodes, never by this filter's
       own counter, which is circular.
    3. The three shapes are the ones this layer has observed. Content that is
       bookkeeping in some fourth shape is not covered, and adding a shape
       requires a pinned reject case first.

    Note on where the primary defence belongs: suppressing this class at the
    PROMPT is strictly better than filtering it after the fact, but recall no
    longer owns the Stage-1 prompt -- ``extract_batch`` builds it from the
    extract package's own fragments, and recall passes only units, infer,
    produced_by and capabilities. So until that forbid-list exists upstream,
    this filter is the sole defence at this layer rather than a second one.

    Only ever invoked from inside the caller's already-narrow high-similarity-non-containment
    trigger band (constraint 1) — not on every ``keep_both``.

    KNOWN, DOCUMENTED, LOW-STAKES GAP (internal design spec, section 9.4, reframed
    section 10.10 item 4): this exact wording — the
    best of 4 tried, across both 4-bit and bf16 Ministral-3-3B — reliably classifies the
    founding case (fixture a, REQUIRED) and a negation-flip (fixture d) correctly, but is NOT
    reliable on same-entity-different-property pairs sharing strong lexical overlap without a
    genuine logical conflict (fixture b) — it over-weights topical/lexical overlap as evidence
    of conflict even when its own stated reasoning correctly identifies the two claims as
    distinct properties. This is a real, reproducible model-capacity limit at this scale, not
    a parsing or prompt-triviality issue; see the spec addendum for the full investigation.
    Under the contested-memory-lifecycle reframe this is a review-queue-noise issue, not a
    safety issue (tracked: recall#900) — a false CONFLICT call here costs a confidence dip and
    a queue entry on both nodes, never a lost fact; the judge is a flagger, not a resolver.

    Parsed strictly and conservatively: anything other than a response that starts with
    exactly "CONFLICT" (case-insensitive, after stripping whitespace) returns ``None``
    (uncertain), never ``True`` — a malformed response, an unexpected model utterance, or an
    inference exception must never be silently treated as evidence of conflict.

    (zero recall coupling). extract_batch calls this SYNCHRONOUSLY (never awaited), so it
    stays a plain function.

    ``max_tokens`` is read PER-REQUEST from an optional ``request["max_tokens"]`` key. One

# identify -> extract_batch -> reconcile with everything defaulting to "create" drops
# corroborate/contradict entirely -> node inflation (the ~70-vs-46 over-feeding dogfood).
# B2 restores the monolith's action-logic (existing-knowledge-in-context -> action +
# existing_id) as its own focused pass, batched per cluster, over B1's clean extracted facts.
#
# GATE (reframed 2026-07-14, Opus ratified): the frontier ideal (185 nodes) turned
# out to be an END-STATE node-set (no action/existing_id/contradiction fields, 0 corpus
# reversals) — NOT a per-fact action-gold, so B2 has no standalone corpus-accuracy gate the way
# identify did. This is a MECHANISM gate (synthetic existing-knowledge + facts via a fake infer,
# proving create/corroborate/contradict all fire correctly — see test_consolidate_action_-
# decision.py). Corpus-scale contradiction accuracy is descoped v1 (0 examples to validate
# against); the anti-inflation + 40-merge-group corroboration claim is measured by the Phase-C
# dogfood (B2+B3 end-state vs the 185-node ideal), not here.
#
# REVIEW FIXES (2026-07-14, Sentinel + Opus REQUEST-CHANGES, both independently fruit/code-
# confirmed): the first cut had 3 wiring gaps —
#   1. dense-cluster inflation: the per-CLUSTER action call inherited B1's flat per-UNIT
#      800-token floor, so a response covering many candidates truncated partway and every
#      unaddressed index fail-closed to "create" — the "inflation fix" silently didn't fix
#      inflation on dense clusters. Fixed: _estimate_action_decision_budget scales with
#      candidate count.
#   2. fail-closed-to-create persisted duplicates: an unaddressed/malformed index defaults to
#      create + existing_id=None with no dedup check. Fixed: _normalize_for_dedup + an exact-
#      match check against existing_nodes converts a create whose content is verbatim-
#      identical (mod case/whitespace) to corroborate — cheap, deterministic, belt-and-
#      suspenders ahead of reconcile's own fuzzy dedup, which stays untouched.
#   3. temporal_refs discarded — SUPERSEDED, see below (the temporal_refs-derivation fix and
#      its 2026-07-14 minor follow-up were both correct-in-isolation but built against a
#      hand-built envelope, not the REAL extract_batch contract; abandoned in favor of a
#      content-based per-fact approach once that was fruit-checked, see next block).
#
# TEMPORAL — ROLE, LANDED (2026-07-15, extract#31 merged to extract sprint-39): the two prior
# attempts were both duct tape — the temporal_refs-derivation cut (built against a hand-built
# envelope; role/resolved_end were unreachable at the base capability) and the B2-LLM-judges-
# temporal cut (recall re-deriving via a SECOND LLM pass what extraction already read once). The
# right fix lives in extract and now ships: extraction emits a validity ROLE (effective/expiry/
# range/superseded/point) + resolved date at the BASE temporal_refs capability, and threads each
# unit's SOURCE date as the relative-date resolution anchor (internal design spec).
# recall consumes it DETERMINISTICALLY, no LLM re-judgment: _EXTRACT_-
# CAPABILITIES requests temporal_refs; _extract_cluster_units threads BatchUnit.date
# (_candidate_source_date); _flatten_envelope_facts maps role -> valid_from/valid_until
# (_map_temporal_refs_to_bounds); _decide_actions PASSES THE BOUND THROUGH without judging it (the
# action LLM never touches temporal). A ref-less fact falls back to null — honest fallback, not the
# old unconditional placeholder. Budget (#1, _estimate_action_decision_budget) and dedup (#2,
# _normalize_for_dedup) are UNAFFECTED — independent of temporal, already fruit-confirmed by two
# reviewers, stay exactly as they are.
#
# FULL-PATH REVIEW FIXES (2026-07-15, Sentinel REQUEST CHANGES, both real, ratified by Opus after
# withdrawing his own approve on these two surfaces):
#   1. FAN-OUT FABRICATION: the first cut shared one unit-level bound onto every fact/decision the
#      unit emitted. Sentinel's real full-eb.json fruit killed the "rare" premise: 61/62 compound
#      units emit >1 output (mean 5.0) — compounds are preserved BY DESIGN so extract can atomize
#      them. Fixed in _flatten_envelope_facts: bounds SUPPRESS entirely once a unit yields >1
#      usable output — losing the one true bound beats fabricating it onto N-1 siblings.
#   2. RECONCILE SILENTLY DROPS BOUNDS ON CORROBORATE/CONTRADICT: bounds only ever reached
#      _apply_consolidation_result's create branch. The exact-match dedup guard MECHANICALLY
#      converts many creates to corroborate, so a real temporal fact routinely lost its bound one
#      layer past where the B2 tests stopped looking (dict, not persisted node). Fixed: corroborate
#      fills only MISSING persisted bounds (never overwrites a conflicting one); contradict carries
#      candidate bounds onto the replacement node AND the queued-contradiction payload — which
#      required a pending_contradictions schema migration (storage.py) and a fix to
#      server.py's _apply_supersession (previously hardcoded valid_from=now/valid_until=None on
#      confirm), so the round trip survives to the actually-persisted node, not just the queue row.

You are deciding how new facts relate to existing knowledge.

## Existing Knowledge
{existing_knowledge}

## New Facts (indexed)
{candidates}

## Task
For EACH new fact above, decide exactly one action:
- "create": this is genuinely new information, not already captured above.
- "corroborate": this confirms/reinforces an EXISTING node — give its exact [id] from above.
- "contradict": this REVERSES or invalidates an EXISTING node's claim — give its exact [id] \
and a one-sentence contradiction_note explaining the reversal.

Rules:
1. Only use "corroborate" or "contradict" when you can cite the EXACT existing node id shown \
in brackets above. Never invent an id.
2. Default to "create" when uncertain.
3. contradiction_note is required for "contradict", omit or leave empty otherwise.

Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences, no explanation. One action object PER fact index, \
matched by "index" (not by list position):

    contract-read Finding 3) with no fallback gap.

    ``valid_from``/``valid_until`` come from each fact's unit-level ``temporal_refs``, mapped

    carries null (the honest fallback), and a garbage action response fail-closes the ACTION to
    create while the bound rides through unchanged — temporal is decoupled from the action.

    FAIL-CLOSED, never drops a fact: an unparseable/malformed response, an infer exception, an
    invalid action value, or any fact index the response didn't address all degrade that fact's
    ACTION to "create" (mirrors the monolith's own existing_id-not-found -> create fallback) —
    the fact itself is always represented in the output (count-invariant, matching B1's
    discipline at this layer). A create-defaulted (or model-CHOSEN-create) fact whose content
    EXACTLY matches (``_normalize_for_dedup``) an already-existing node is converted to
    corroborate that node instead — never-drop must not mean never-dedup; see the REVIEW FIXES
    module note (blocker #2, the persisted-duplicate finding).

    ``infer`` is the SAME pluggable sync seam B1 uses (``_make_recall_infer``) — one call per
    cluster (a cluster's facts + its existing-knowledge set are bounded, so batching per cluster
    is v1; see the B2 spec for the per-fact-vs-batched tradeoff). The request's ``max_tokens``
    is scaled to candidate count (``_estimate_action_decision_budget``, blocker #1) — a flat
    per-unit floor silently truncated dense clusters and mass-triggered the fail-closed path.

    ``source_turns`` is intentionally always ``[]`` here — see module note: the deterministic
    prefilter's ``Candidate.attr`` (session_id/entry_index/field/index) is NOT transcript-turn-
    shaped, and populating a KnowledgeNode's ``source_turns`` with a non-turn value would make
    ``resolve_source_turns()`` SKIP real enrichment for that node forever (its early-exit is
    ``if node.source_turns: continue``, verified at consolidate.py) — worse than leaving it
    empty for the SAME post-processing resolver that already backfills genuine transcript

#

# ever reassembles. The Phase C dogfood (internal design spec)
# found the decomposed path finds more and lies less than legacy but fragments compound
# memories (378 nodes vs the 185-node frontier ideal, boundary F1 9.1% vs legacy's 23.0%) —
# and fragmentation CORRUPTS truth (3 concrete false memories in verification). B4 rejoins:
# it takes a cluster's CREATE-bound action items and composes them into compound memories at
# ideal granularity before reconcile executes. Only CREATE items participate — corroborate/
# contradict target existing nodes and carry no new granularity, so they pass through B4
# untouched and never reach the model.
#
# Five contract guards, each its own mechanism-TDD test (recall#883, Sentinel):
#   1. COUNT-INVARIANT, never-drop: every create index appears in exactly one output group.
#      A group with ANY invalid/hallucinated index is dropped WHOLE (per-group degradation —
#      the composed text was written describing a membership set that doesn't exist once one
#      member is fake; trusting it for the survivors would persist text written for a
#      different group). Duplicate membership ACROSS groups invalidates the ENTIRE response
#      (whole-cluster fail-open) — a stronger violation than a single bad group, since it
#      means the model's own bookkeeping is incoherent, not just one group's target set.
#   2. COMPOSE FROM MEMBERS ONLY: v1 enforcement is PROMPT-LEVEL (the composition prompt pins
#      anti-corruption instructions against the three observed truth-corruption classes —
#      negation flip, convention misread, relation/causal misread). Runtime entailment
#      checking is v2, gated on the dogfood's source-clean precision axis.
#   3. METADATA UNION: tags unioned, category by majority-of-members (ties broken by the
#      FIRST member in the MODEL's own group order — Counter.most_common()'s stable sort
#      naturally does this when members are visited in group order). Durable NODE-level
#      provenance is a v2 follow-up; v1 traceability lives in the decision log (member
#      source_unit_ids + content digests + composed content), keeping B3/KnowledgeNode
#      unchanged.
#   4. TEMPORAL CONFLICT RULE: identical bounds across bounded members -> carry; conflicting
#      non-null bounds (including two members with different single-sided bounds that would
#      otherwise synthesize an unasserted range) -> the group is REJECTED and its members
#      revert to individual pass-through (per-group degradation, same mechanism as #1's
#      invalid-index drop — NOT the whole-cluster fail-open of #1's duplicate case); exactly
#      one bounded member -> carry that member's bound verbatim (safe because #878's fan-out
#      suppression already made "non-null bound => sole output of its source unit" true at
#      write time — no text re-detection needed here).
#   5. FAIL-OPEN degradation: an unparseable/wrong-shape response or an infer exception
#      degrades the WHOLE cluster's creates to pass-through, never blocked, never dropped —
#      plus a loud, non-silent B4_COMPOSE_FAIL_OPEN warning naming the cluster and reason.

You are grouping and composing related facts into compound memories.

## Facts to consider (indexed)

## Task
Decide which of the facts above describe the SAME underlying memory and should be composed \
together into one compound entry. A fact that stands alone should be its own singleton group.

For EACH fact index above, put it in exactly one group. Give each group's member indices and \
ONE composed content string for that group.

Also decide, for each group, whether it "supersedes" any OTHER index — meaning that OTHER \
index describes the SAME subject at an earlier point in time, and this group's content \
updates, corrects, or contradicts it (not merely relates to it or shares its vocabulary). \
List those other indices in a "supersedes" array (empty if none). Two facts about the same \
subject that are simply complementary, not in conflict, are NOT a supersession — shared \
vocabulary alone is never enough; only flag a genuine same-subject update, correction, or \
contradiction.

Rules:
1. Compose ONLY from the given MEMBER facts — never assert a relation, cause, or qualifier \
that is not directly present in a member's own text. Do not flip a negation (a fact stating \
something is unrelated must stay unrelated in the composition). Do not alter a stated \
convention or definition (e.g. what a label means) when restating it.
2. Every index above must appear in EXACTLY ONE group.
3. Output ONLY valid JSON, no markdown fences, no explanation.

    For each active knowledge node, finds the best-matching sentence spans

    offsets (begin, end) so retrieval can extract precise snippets instead
    of formatting entire turns.

    When a node already has ``source_turns`` (from ``resolve_source_turns``),
    those turns are used as direct candidates — skipping the token-overlap
    scan entirely.  This improves coverage for short or abstract nodes that
    would otherwise fail the overlap threshold.
