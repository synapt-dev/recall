"""Immutable generation directories + an atomically-swapped CURRENT
pointer, for the one write path that was never safe under concurrency:
a sharded index's full rebuild (``ShardedRecallDB.save_chunks``'s
data-shard-recreation branch), which today closes every shard
connection, deletes every shard file, then rebuilds from scratch with
no atomicity spanning those steps -- a reader mid-rebuild can see a
missing or partial shard set.

The fix, ratified by Layne: each rebuild writes a brand-new, complete,
self-contained generation of data shards under
``<index_dir>/generations/<name>/`` before it is ever visible to a
reader. Publishing is one atomic ``os.replace`` of a ``CURRENT``
pointer file, guarded by a compare-and-swap on the parent generation a
writer read before it started rebuilding: if some other writer has
already published since then, the CAS fails and the caller rebuilds
again against the new parent (bounded retry), rather than clobbering
newer work or racing to publish over it.

This module covers only the DATA SHARDS (``data_NNN.db``) that
``save_chunks`` currently deletes-and-recreates in place. ``index.db``
(knowledge, clusters, query_tail overlay, shard_metadata) is untouched
and stays outside the generation system for now -- see the module
docstring in ``sharded_db.py`` for the disclosed follow-up scope.

    -- keeps finding real, current shards instead of silently finding
    none and returning empty results (the silent-wrong-answer class,
    not a mere staleness class: multiple recall versions read the same
    store concurrently on this host today).

    A real COPY, not a hard link. Hard links were tried first (cheaper:
    same filesystem, near-instant, no duplicated bytes) and measured
    unsafe: even with the WAL fully checkpointed before closing the
    writer's connection (this module does that -- see rebuild_and_publish),
    two independent PATHS sharing one inode each get their OWN, separate
    ``-wal``/``-shm`` sidecar files under SQLite's WAL mode, which is a
    documented hazard for concurrent access to what SQLite believes are
    two different databases occupying the same bytes -- reproduced
    directly: a concurrent reader hit "disk I/O error" opening a
    hard-linked shard under real contention (the two-writer proof test,
    under full-suite load). A copy has no shared inode and no shared
    WAL-mode bookkeeping at all, so this hazard cannot occur; the cost is
    real I/O instead of a syscall, accepted for correctness.

    Each shard's swap into place is a full copy under a temp name, then
    one atomic ``os.replace`` over the real name, so an old reader's glob
    never observes a partially-written file at any single shard name.
    Across MULTIPLE shard names in one sync, an old reader's own glob
    (which was never atomic to begin with -- a rebuild-in-progress under
    the pre-generation code could already show a partial set) can still
    observe a brief mix of some updated and some still-stale names; this
    is strictly better than the alternative it replaces (returning
    nothing at all), and is the accepted, disclosed bound.

    Best-effort: a failure here (e.g. a disk-full mid-copy) is logged,
    not raised -- it only degrades an OLD reader back to pre-fix
    behavior, and must never fail the publish a NEW reader depends on.
