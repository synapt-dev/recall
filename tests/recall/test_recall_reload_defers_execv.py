"""recall_reload must not call os.execv() before returning its own response.

Calling os.execv() inline, before the function returns, preempts
the JSON-RPC response for the reload call itself — a live MCP client waiting
on that call's reply gets nothing and times out, then the fresh (exec'd)
process rejects the client's next call because its MCP session was never
initialized by that connection. Measured with a minimal stdio client against
the real server subprocess: the reload call timed out, and the next call on
the same connection raised "Invalid request parameters" (received before
initialization was complete).

recall_reload must return its response BEFORE the process is replaced, so
os.execv() is deferred a short moment via a background timer.

CAUTION for anyone extending these tests: the deferred timer must never be
left pending when a test's ``patch("os.execv", ...)`` context exits. A stray
timer that fires after the patch is gone hits the REAL os.execv() and
replaces the pytest process itself, not a fixture -- caught in review
(Stromus, R2 on the original version of this file): test 1 originally
exited its patch block immediately after the ordering assertion, so its
timer fired ~0.2s later against the unpatched, real os.execv, re-executing
pytest with the same argv. Measured effects of that version: the test alone
looped forever (each re-exec re-ran the test, which scheduled a new stray
timer); the two-test file together happened to pass only because test 2's
own patch caught test 1's leftover timer by pure timing luck; a third file
appended after this one got no pytest summary at all, because by then
nothing was patched when the timer fired. Every test below stays inside its
patch context until its timer has already fired, and the regression witness
runs the whole module in a real subprocess so a stray timer can never be
masked by a neighbor's patch.

    A trivial single-test pytest run finishes and the interpreter exits in
    well under recall_reload's ~0.2s deferred-execv window -- even a
    non-daemon pending timer thread can lose that race if nothing keeps the
    process alive a little longer, which would silently hide a stray timer
    rather than exercise it. This test runs alongside the target test in the
    SAME subprocess/session, so a stray timer left pending by a buggy test
    has time to actually fire while something still patches os.execv (a
    passing run) or does not (the defect this file guards against).

    A fixed sleep(0.3) here was only a ~50% margin over the exact 0.2s
    interval recall_reload() schedules, and the mechanism under test IS a
    timing race: any scheduler preemption of this sleeping process (a loaded
    CI runner) eats directly into that margin. server.py exposes the actual
    pending timer at module level for exactly this purpose (see
    `_pending_reload_timer`'s docstring: "so a test... can cancel it rather
    than let it fire against an unpatched/unexpected os.execv later") --
    join() on it waits for the real completion signal (the timer thread
    itself finishing), bounded by a real deadline, rather than guessing how
    long "past the window" needs to be. If the preceding test already
    consumed its own timer (the healthy case), the timer has already
    finished and this returns immediately instead of always paying 0.3s.
