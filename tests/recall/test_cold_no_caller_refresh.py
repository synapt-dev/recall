"""Cold no-caller resume refresh (durable-checkpoint follow-on; R3.1 recall#435).

On a cold cross-runtime launch there is no caller transcript, so the caller-tail
refresh has nothing to act on and the shared index can be months stale. The
load-bearing guarantees, each with a witness here:

  * the read NEVER WAITS on a held build lock: a held lock (recall#1018 ghost
    lock included) queues NOTHING and returns immediately (control);
  * R3.1: the free-lock leg no longer builds INLINE -- a real refire on the
    167,762-chunk store cost ~14 minutes of foreground wall (Stromus,
    2026-09-05), which is not an acceptable interactive cost. It releases the
    probe lock and spawns a DETACHED background process that does the exact
    same build, and returns "queued_background" the instant the process is
    spawned -- never waiting on it;
  * it NEVER RAISES: every failure in the check itself (discovery, data-dir,
    lock acquire/release, or spawning the background process) degrades to the
    stale render;
  * the queued background process builds into the SAME store the load reads,
    not a cwd-derived secondary one (this change's R2 store split; still true
    here since the store/source split is baked into the spawned script's argv);
  * a queued-but-not-yet-fresher render is legible as such: the label names the
    source and how many files are behind, distinct from an actual completed
    refresh's "REFRESHED before render" phrasing (which no code path emits
    anymore, since nothing completes inline).
