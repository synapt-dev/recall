"""TDD spec: `synapt recall build` must be idempotent.

Contract under test
-------------------
A second consecutive build over an unchanged store must do ~zero work, run
fast, and SAY that it skipped. Today it does not: measured on a frozen
4-transcript corpus (39MB, 1,709 chunks) with mtimes pinned, a run that parsed
ZERO files still took 40.9s. The build has exactly one change-detector
(``core.build_index``, mtime+size) and it guards the cheapest stage; every
expensive stage downstream is unconditional.

Why the controls in here are not optional
-----------------------------------------
The cheapest way to make every "did it skip?" assertion pass is to skip
unconditionally, which would turn a slow build into a broken one. So each skip
assertion is paired with a NEGATIVE control that changes exactly one input and
demands the build notice. A suite that only proves skipping is a suite that
cannot fail the worst available implementation.

That pairing is not hypothetical caution — the harness that produced the
measurements above shipped a bad control first: it touched an mtime against a
freshness check keyed on SIZE, so it was aimed at a quantity the code does not
read, and it "passed" while proving nothing.
