"""TDD spec: recall#435 follow-on -- the bounded recluster maintenance op.

recall#435's ``skip_clustering`` build path (merged) saves transcript chunks
to FTS5 without clustering them, so they stay unclustered until something
else clusters them. This is that something else: ``synapt maintain
--recluster``, which clusters the oldest bounded batch of stale chunks and
reports what is left.

The load-bearing property under test is the memory bound: the op must never
reload the already-clustered corpus to add a small batch. Concretely, that
means it must call the ADDITIVE ``append_clusters`` (insert-only), never the
full-corpus-REPLACE ``save_clusters`` (deletes every existing topic cluster
first) -- using the wrong one would silently erase every already-clustered
chunk the first time the maintenance op ran on a real store. That distinction
is asserted directly, not just inferred from an end-to-end count.
